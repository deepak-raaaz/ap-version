    <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-200 mt-4">Preparing the Surface</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mt-2">Before applying wall putty, it’s essential to prepare the surface. Clean the wall thoroughly, removing any dust, grease, or loose particles.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-200 mt-4">Mixing the Putty</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mt-2">Mix the putty with water to form a smooth paste. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the correct ratio of water to putty.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-200 mt-4">Application Techniques</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mt-2">Use a putty knife or trowel to apply the putty to the wall. Spread it evenly, ensuring a smooth finish. Apply multiple thin coats rather than one thick coat for the best results.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-200 mt-4">Skipping Surface Preparation</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mt-2">Proper surface preparation is crucial for a smooth finish. Skipping this step can lead to an uneven surface and poor adhesion.</p>

        <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mt-2">White cement is a type of hydraulic cement that is similar to gray Portland cement but is distinct because of its white color.

        <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mt-2">White cement is made from limestone, clay, and gypsum. The iron and manganese content in white cement is significantly lower than that in gray cement, which gives it its unique white color. White cement is known for its high degree of fineness, strength, and durability.</p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Ordinary White Cement:</strong> This is the most commonly used type of white cement, suitable for general construction purposes where aesthetics are important.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Early-Strength White Cement:</strong> This type of white cement is formulated to provide early strength, making it ideal for projects that require quick setting and early removal of formwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Specialty White Cement:</strong> Specialty white cement includes formulations designed for specific applications, such as high durability, water resistance, or enhanced aesthetic finishes.</li>
